Attenuation tomography code accompanying the study "Hydrothermal fluids and where to find them: Using seismic attenuation and anisotropy to map fluids beneath Uturuncu volcano, Bolivia", by T Hudson et al..

Please note that this code is not supported as a formal package release, but rather to provide the method used in the above paper. Please feel free to use/inspire for similar work, although note that there are other good, formally released packages out there to do attenuation tomography.
